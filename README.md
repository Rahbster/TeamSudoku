### WebRTC Sudoku ðŸŽ®

This is a two-player, cooperative Sudoku game that uses WebRTC to establish a real-time, peer-to-peer connection. Unlike traditional online games, this application does not require a central server for gameplay; instead, it uses a unique QR code-based system for the initial connection setup, with a fallback option for manual signaling.

Once connected, both players work on the same puzzle, with their moves instantly synchronized to their partner's screen. The game features real-time validation and a responsive UI that highlights conflicts and celebrates a solved puzzle.

### How to Play

1.  **Start the Game:** Open the `index.html` file in a browser on two separate devices. You will need a simple local web server for this to work correctly due to browser security restrictions.
2.  **Player 1 (Host):**
    * Select your "Connection Method" (QR Code Scan is recommended).
    * Choose "Player 1 (Host)" as your role.
    * Click **"Create Offer"** to generate the QR codes.
    * Display the QR codes to Player 2. Use the "Next" and "Previous" buttons to navigate between the chunks.
3.  **Player 2 (Joiner):**
    * Select your "Connection Method" (QR Code Scan is recommended).
    * Choose "Player 2 (Joiner)" as your role.
    * Click **"Start QR Scanner"** and point your camera at Player 1's screen to scan all the QR codes.
    * Once the scan is complete, an answer will be generated. Show the answer QR codes to Player 1.
4.  **Complete the Connection:** Player 1 scans the answer QR codes from Player 2's screen. The connection will then be established.
5.  **Enjoy:** Once connected, any move you make on the grid will be instantly reflected on your partner's screen!

### Technical Details

#### Peer-to-Peer Communication
The core of this application is a **WebRTC Data Channel**, which provides a low-latency, secure, and direct connection between the two browsers. This eliminates the need for a persistent central server, reducing hosting costs and potential points of failure.

#### QR Code Signaling
WebRTC requires a "signaling" phase to exchange session metadata (SDP) between peers. This project uses a novel approach to solve this without a server:
* The large SDP data is split into smaller, manageable chunks.
* Each chunk is encoded into a separate QR code, with an embedded index (e.g., `[1/5]:DATA`) to prevent re-scanning and ensure proper reassembly.
* The `html5-qrcode` library handles camera access and scanning, while `qrcode.js` generates the QR codes.

#### Game Logic
The game logic is handled entirely on the client side. The `scripts.js` file manages the following:
* **Real-Time Sync:** Moves are sent as JSON objects through the WebRTC data channel and processed in real-time.
* **Input Handling:** Cells can be filled by clicking to cycle through numbers 1-9.
* **Validation:** The grid is validated with every move to check for conflicts in rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids. Conflicting cells are highlighted in red.
* **UI/UX:** The interface includes visual cues for solved puzzles, active cells, and highlights for all cells containing the same number.
